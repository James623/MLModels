Movie Recommendation 
====================

The MovieLens data sets are popular data sets for building
recommendation models in research, education and development. The
dataset (ml-latest-small) used in this demonstration contains 100,004
5-star ratings across 9125 movies created by 671 users between 9
January 1995 and 16 October 2016. The dataset records the userId,
movieId, rating, timestamp, title, and genres. The goal is to build a
recommendation model to recommend new movies to users.

This pre-built model has used the R language to build a recommendation
model to represent the knowledge discovered using a so-called Smart
Adaptive Recommendations (SAR) algorithm. The knowledge representation
is easy to understand. The computation time is of the order of seconds
on the GPU based Azure Deep Learning Virtual Machine whilst it is
hours on the CPU based Azure Data Science Virtual Machine.

Using Australian Ports Dataset to Visualise Data
================================================

This is a demonstration "model" showing the concepts of visualising
data in order to better understand our data.

The examples come from chapter 5 of the book Essentials of Data
Science, by Graham Williams
`<https://bit.ly/essentials_data_science>`_.

The data used comes from
`<https://essentials.togaware.com/ports.xlsx>`_.

For further support material visit
`<https://essentials.togaware.com/>`_.

The **demo** command steps through a series of different options for
the visualising data.

The **print** command displays the code used.

For the actual code visit the github repository at:

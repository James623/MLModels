====================================
Visualise Data Through Scatter Plots
====================================

This is a very simple demonstration "model" showing the concept of
scatter plots using the traditional Iris dataset.

The **demo** command steps through a series of different options for
the display of a scatter plot.

The **print** command displays the code used.

Run the **score** command to generate a scatter plot on the first two
columns of a supplied CSV dataset.

Visit the `github
repository<https://github.com/mlhubber/mlmodels/tree/master/scatter-plots-r>`_
for the sample code.

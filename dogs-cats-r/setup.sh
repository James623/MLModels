# Need a script here to create the prebuilt models. They are not put
# into github as they are large and also they are generated. This is
# not something for the user but for the model builder.
#
# See resnet152 for an example.
#
# Data seems to come from Kaggle. Is there another source not requiring
# a login? Model author needs to confirm licensing limitations before
# the data can be distributed. Then in this script include the
# download instructions.
# 
# Kaggle dogs vs cats data set: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data
# Microsoft Research: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765
#
# The prebuilt model files come from the R script train.R.

Object Recognition
==================

This model is based on the `deep learning kubernetes
tutorial <https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/2018/04/19/deploying-deep-learning-models-on-kubernetes-with-gpus/>`__
by Mathew Salvaris and Fidan Boylu Uz of Microsoft. The code comes from
their `github
repository <https://github.com/Microsoft/AKSDeploymentTutorial>`__
containing a number of tutorials in Jupyter notebooks that have
step-by-step instructions on how to deploy a pretrained deep learning
model on a GPU enabled Kubernetes cluster.

The pre-trained
`ResNet152 <https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/modules/google/imagenet/resnet_v1_152/classification/1>`__
model is used. Sample images are provided, pre-processed to the required
format and classified using the model.

Visit the `github repository
<https://Github.com/mlhubber/mlmodels/tree/master/resnet152>`_.  for
the sample code.

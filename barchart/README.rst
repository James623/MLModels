Visualise Data Through Barcharts
================================

This `MLHub <https://mlhub.ai>`_ package provides a simple
demonstration "model" showing the concept of bar charts. This is
useful for the new data scientist learning the power of visualising
data. Barcharts are one simple yet effective approach to understanding
the narrative the data can tell us.

To install and run the pre-built model::

  $ pip install mlhub
  $ ml install barchart
  $ ml demo barchart

The examples come from the Essentials of Data Science by Graham
Williams `<https://bit.ly/essentials_data_science>`_. Further support
material is also available from `<https://essentials.togaware.com/>`_.

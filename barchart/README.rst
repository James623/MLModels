Visualise Data Through Barcharts
================================

This `MLHub <https://mlhub.ai>`_ package provides a simple
demonstration "model" showing the concept of bar charts. This is
useful for the new data scientist learning the power of visualising
data. Barcharts are one simple yet effective approach to understanding
the narrative the data can tell us.

To install the pre-built model::

  $ ml install barchart

The examples in this model come from the Essentials of Data
Science by Graham Williams
`<https://bit.ly/essentials_data_science>`_. Further support
material is also available from `<https://essentials.togaware.com/>`_.

Visualise Data Through Barcharts
================================

This package provides a simple demonstration "model" showing the
concept of bar charts. This is useful for the new data scientist
learning how to visualise data. Barcharts are one simple yet effective
approach to understanding the narrative the data is trying to tell us.

The examples in this model come from the Essentials of Data
Science by Graham Williams
`<https://bit.ly/essentials_data_science>`_. Further support
material is also available from `<https://essentials.togaware.com/>`_.

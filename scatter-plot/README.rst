Visualise Data Through Scatter Plots
====================================

This `MLHub <https://mlhub.ai>`_ package provides a simple
demonstration "model" showing the concept of scatter plots using the
traditional Iris dataset.

To install and run the pre-built model::

  $ pip install mlhub
  $ ml install scatter-plot
  $ ml demo scatter-plot

The examples come from the book, Essentials of Data Science, by Graham
Williams `<https://bit.ly/essentials_data_science>`_. Further support
material is also available from `<https://essentials.togaware.com/>`_.

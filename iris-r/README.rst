Classifying Iris Plant Species
==============================

The famous IRIS dataset is a traditional statistics demonstration
dataset for building classification models. It contains data for 3
different class of iris (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) with 50
observations of each class. Each observation records the flower's
petal length and width and the sepal length and width, together with
the known class. The goal is to build a classification model to
classify new observations of flowers.

This pre-built model has used the R language to build a classification
tree model to represent the knowledge discovered using a so-called
recursive partitioning algorithm. The knowledge representation is easy
to understand.

The *demo* applies the pre-built model to a same data set and
illustrates that quite an accurate model can be readily built from
this historic data.

The *print* will display a textual summary of the model and its build
parameters. The textual presentation can be difficult to take in at
first and so the *display* will draw the model as a decision tree.

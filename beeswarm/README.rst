====================
Bee Swarm Style Plots
====================

Bee swarm plots are a form of scatter plot that aim to avoid the usual
overlay of points that occur with scatterplots. This is the scenario
where the dataset contains multiple observations of the same data
points and plotting them on a two dimensional plot simply overlays the
points. With beeswarm plots the points are jittered whilst retaining
some semblance of density.

The `ggbeeswarm package`_ for R based on `ggplot`_ was written by Erik Clarke and Scott
Sherrill-Mix and this `MLHub`_ demonstration is based on their
`README`_.

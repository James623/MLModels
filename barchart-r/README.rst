Visualise Data Through Barcharts
================================

This is a very simple demonstration "model" showing the concept of bar
charts.

The examples come from the book, Essentials of Data Science, by Graham
Williams `<https://bit.ly/essentials_data_science>`_. For further
support material visit `<https://essentials.togaware.com/>`_.

The **demo** command steps through a series of different options for
the display of a bar chart.

The **print** command displays the code used.

Run the **score** command to generate a bar chart from a supplied CSV
dataset.

For the sample code visit the github repository at:

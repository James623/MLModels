# MODEL QUEUE

Below is simply a list of material that could be potential MLHub
packages. In each case the license of the source must be considered,
and permission of the author obtained. If a github repository then
fork and then work through pull requests to the author

## text to speech
* ml score txtspeak "This is a substantially different effort"
* use MS cognitive service
